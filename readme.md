# Retro Television

## About

As a new parent, I created this project to allow fellow parents to have the ability to select pre-approved TV programmes for their children to watch whilst giving a retro feel with the ability to _skip channel_ if the kids want to watch something else. It is intended to run cross-platform and uses local media files for playback.
